                    education.

                    must agree to a partnership relationship with KCA in the education and training of their
                    child/children.
                    Parents

        <h2>Eligibility for Admission</h2>

                is not
                equipped to meet the needs of students with disabilities. KCA can only provide educational services
                according to
                the qualifications of current faculty members. Some examples of support needs that we are not currently
                able

                <li><p>Students with a record of discipline issues, multiple suspensions or expulsion</p></li>

                </li>
