              I can't recommend KCA highly enough. This school gives students a
              real chance to flourish and step into leadership roles in ways
              that might not be possible at bigger schools. The opportunities I
              got from the activities I joined boosted my confidence in my
              ability to learn and succeed in anything I set my mind to, and
              opened doors to continuing my participation in those activities
              through the rest of my life. The small class sizes allow each
              student to really get to know each other and create a family-like
              atmosphere. The students at KCA are not only intelligent and
              talented but also profound thinkers, adding incredible depth to
              interactions. The teachers care deeply about their students. They
              provided invaluable and real advice which I still hold onto. I
              have extremely fond memories of the traditions that the school has
              and I’m so grateful for getting to grow up in an environment like
              KCA. I wouldn't trade my time there for anything

              Kyiv Christian Academy has partnered with us in educating all five
              of our children for over twenty years. Having lived in many
              countries each with a different language and culture, we needed a
              quality English education that would prepare our children for
              American Universities. So, when we arrived here from Israel, we
              were delighted to find this American school, KCA, that taught in
              the context of a Biblical worldview. We were delighted to find
              this accredited American school taught in English and within a
              Judeo-Christian context. The school was even NCAA approved for
              student athletes headed to play on university sports teams in the
              US.  Our children were safe, they made lasting friendships and
              they received excellent educations. We are very grateful to Kyiv
              Christian Academy.

              My husband and I are French and American. We have four kids who
              attended KCA. When we were displaced from the country where we had
              been serving, we chose to move our family to Kyiv because of KCA. 
              Our four kids loved the school! Three of them have already
              graduated from KCA and found that their academic preparation for
              college was excellent.  In addition, at KCA they received hands-on
              ministry and leadership training through a rich variety of
              extra-curricular options. Go Eagles!
