          Kyiv Christian Academy was granted accreditation by one of the major
          U.S. accrediting agencies, Middle States Association on February 13,
          2021. This is a result of the hard work of the KCA staff and parents
          that comprised the accreditation committees last year. KCA was
          re-accredited by the Association of Christian Schools International
          (ACSI). These acknowledgements are for 7 years. We look forward to
          working with Middle States and to continuing our relationship with
          ACSI as we strive for excellence.
