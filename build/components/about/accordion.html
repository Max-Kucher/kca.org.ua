            Located in Ukraine, Kyiv Christian Academy is a private
            interdenominational Christian school that was founded in 1993 to
            provide students with an excellent academic experience based upon
            solid Christian principles. It is a K-12 international school in
            Kyiv, Ukraine. There are 151 students enrolled in grades K-12.
          </p>
          <p>
            The students are primarily from missionary families representing
            many different organizations, denominations, and countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our faculty is composed of teachers from the U.S. and Ukraine. Our
            academic program is challenging, reflected in an average ACT score
            of 26.5 by our last 3 senior classes (U.S. average was 20.3 in
            2014). Our graduates have been accepted into many excellent
            universities, including Yale, Georgetown, Wake Forest, William &
            Mary, the Naval Academy, Carnegie Mellon, Wheaton College, Grove
            City, Biola, Rice, University of Chicago, and the University of
            Virginia to name a few.

          <ul>
            <li>
              We believe the scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, to be
              the uniquely inspired Word of God, without error in the original
              writings, the complete revelation of His will for the salvation of
              men, and the divine and final authority for all Christian faith
              and life.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in one God, the Creator, eternally existing in three
              persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that Jesus Christ was begotten by the Holy Spirit and
              born of the Virgin Mary and was and remains true God and true man.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that Jesus Christ lived a sinless life and died on the
              cross as a sacrifice for our sins according to the Scriptures. He
              arose bodily from the dead and ascended into heaven, where, from
              His throne of majesty, he continues to be our High Priest and
              Advocate.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that humanity was specially created in the image of
              God, but, in rebelling against God’s rule, fell into sin. As a
              result, all are lost and stand guilty before the righteous
              judgment of God; it is only through regeneration by the Holy
              Spirit that salvation and spiritual life can be secured.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that the shed blood of Jesus Christ and His
              resurrection provide the only ground for justification and
              salvation for all who believe, and that only those who, by faith,
              receive Jesus Christ are born of the Holy Spirit, thus becoming
              children of God. This eternal salvation is wholly a work of God’s
              grace, freely given to all who repent and believe in Jesus Christ.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the
              Lord Jesus Christ, and that, to that end, the Holy Spirit indwells
              and gives spiritual life to all believers, enables them to
              understand Biblical truth, empowers them for godly living, and
              equips them for service and witness.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the personal return of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
              that the hope of His appearing has a vital bearing on the personal
              life and service of the believer.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead: of the believer
              to everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord, and of the
              unbeliever to judgment and conscious separation from God in
              eternal punishment.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that there is one true Church, composed of all persons
              from every generation, tongue, tribe, and nation who, through
              saving faith in Jesus Christ, have been regenerated by the Holy
              Spirit and are united together in the body of Christ, of which He
              is the Head. Furthermore, God admonishes His people to assemble
              regularly for worship, participation in ordinances, edification
              through the Scriptures and mutual encouragement.
